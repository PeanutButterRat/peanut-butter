<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Peanut Butter is my attempt at a dynamically-typed, imperative programming language. It's about as simple as it can get but is also a neat little tool to play around with. It compiles source files into its own bytecode which then runs on a interpreter. Peanut Butter has a syntax like Python, but a compilation process like Java.

It's not going to compete with any professional programming langauge or make its way into any development workflows, but it has some interesting ideas that will keep you busy for a little while.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get Peanut Butter up and running, follow these simple steps shown below.

### Prerequisites

For starters, you will need to download some dependencies.
1. [CMake](https://cmake.org/), Version 3.27+. You can probably get away with a different version, just be sure to change the first line of `CMakeLists.txt`.
2. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PeanutButterRat/peanut-butter.git
   ```

2. Run the build script
   ```sh
   cd peanut-butter  # You should now be in the repo directory.
   ./build.sh  # Build the project.
   ```
3. Once compiled, you can run the automated tests
   ```sh
   ./tests.sh
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use Peanut Butter, create a file with a `.pb` extension with the code you want compiled in it.

```sh
touch hello_world.pb
echo 'print "Hello, World!".' > hello_world.pb  # A simple "Hello, World!" application.
```

Compile the program with `cpbpl`.
```sh
./bin/cpbpl hello_world.pb  # Assuming you are in base directory for the repo.
```

Execute the compiled program with `pbpl`.
```sh
./bin/pbpl hello_world.nut  # Notice the file extension change.
```

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

The only major resource used in this project was the knowledge found in _Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom_. The book is very well written, and got me hooked on language design.
Peanut Butter is largely its own creation and doesn't follow the source code given in the book but rather it relies on the theory presented by the author for implementing a language. 

You can find more it on the author's website at [https://craftinginterpreters.com/](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
